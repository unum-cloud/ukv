/**
 * @brief Opaque multi-modal Database handle.
 * @see `ukv_database_free()`.
 *
 * Properties:
 * - Thread safety: Safe to use across threads after open and before free.
 * - Lifetime: Must live longer than all the transactions.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * In embedded setup this handle manages the lifetime of the database.
 * In that case user must guarantee, that concurrent processes won't be
 * opening the same database (generally same directory).
 *
 * In standalone "client-server" setup, manages the lifetime of the "client".
 * Many concurrent clients can be connecting to the same server from the same
 * process.
 *
 * ## Collections
 *
 * Every database always has at least one collection - the `::ukv_collection_main_k`.
 * That one has no name and can't be deleted. Others are referenced by names.
 * The same database can have many collections, of different modalities:
 * - Binary Large Objects or BLOBs.
 * - Hierarchical documents, like JSONs, BSONs, MessagePacks.
 * - Discrete labeled and potentially directed Graphs.
 * - Paths or collections of string keys.
 *
 * ## Choosing the Engine
 *
 * Dynamic dispatch of engines isn't yet supported.
 *
 * ## CAP Theorem
 *
 * Distributed engines are not yet supported.

 * @brief Opaque Transaction handle.

 * @see https://unum.cloud/ukv/c#transactions
 *
 * Allows ACID-ly grouping operations across different collections and even modalities.
 * This means, that the same transaction might be:
 * - inserting a blob of media data into a collection of images.
 * - updating users metadata in a documents collection to reference new avatar.
 * - introducing links between the user and other in a graph collection...
 * and all of the operations here either succeed or fail together. DBMS will
 * do the synchronization heavy-lifting, so you don't have to.
 *
 * Properties:
 * - Thread safety: None.
 * - Lifetime: Must be freed before the @c ukv_database_t is closed.
 * - Concurrency Control: Optimistic.

 * ## On Variable Length Keys
 *
 * As of current version, 64-bit signed integers are used to allow unique
 * keys in the range from `[0, 2^63)`. 128-bit builds with UUIDs can be
 * considered, but variable length keys are highly discouraged.
 *
 * Using variable length keys forces numerous limitations on the design of a Key-Value store.
 * Besides slow character-wise comparisons it means solving the "persistent space allocation"
 * problem twice - for both keys and values.
 *
 * The recommended approach to dealing with string keys is:
 *
 * 1. Choose a mechanism to generate unique integer keys (UID). Ex: monotonically increasing values.
 * 2. Use "paths" modality to build-up a persistent hash-map of strings to UIDs.
 * 3. Use those UIDs to address the rest of the data in binary, document and graph modalities.
 *
 * This will result in a single conversion point from string to integer representations
 * and will keep most of the system snappy and the interfaces simpler than what they could have been.
