 *
 * @brief Binary Interface Standard for trivial @b BLOB collections.
 *
 * ## Usage Recommendations
 *
 * ### Pack operations into batches wherever possible
 *
 * Using the batch APIs to issue a single read/write request is trivial, but achieving
 * batch-level performance with singular operations is impossible. Especially, with
 * a client-server setup. Regardless of IO layer, a lot of synchronization and locks
 * must be issued to provide consistency.
 *
 * ## Why use offsets?
 *
 * In the underlying layer, using offsets to adds no additional overhead,
 * but what is the point of using them, if we can immediately pass adjusted
 * pointers? It serves two primary purposes:
 *
 * - Supporting input tapes (values_stride = 0, offsets_stride != 0).
 * - List-oriented wrappers (values_stride != 0, offsets_stride = 0).
 *
 * In the first case, we may have received a tape from `ukv_read()`, which we
 * update in-place and write back, without changing the size of the original
 * entries.
 *
 * In the second case, we may be working with higher-level runtimes, like
 * CPython, where objects metadata (like its length) is stored in front of
 * the allocated region. In such cases, we may still need additional memory
 * to store the lengths of the objects, unless those are NULL-terminated
 * strings (lengths = NULL) or if all have the same length (length_stride = 0).
 *
 * Further reading on the implementation of strings and arrays of strings in
 * different languages:
 *
 * - Python/CPython:
 *      https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/bytes.html
 * - JavaScript/V8:
 *      https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/main/include/v8-data.h
 *      https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/main/include/v8-array-buffer.h
 * - GoLang:
 *      https://boakye.yiadom.org/go/strings/
 *      https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/string.go (`stringStruct`)
 *      https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/slice.go (`slice`)

 * @see https://unum.cloud/ukv/c#writes
 *
 * ## Functionality
 *
 * This is one of the two primary methods, together with `ukv_read()`,
 * so its functionality is wide. It knots together various kinds of updates:
 *
 * - Single writes and Batches.
 * - On Head state or a Transactional.
 * - Transparent or Watching through Transactions.
 * - Upserting, Clearing or Removing values.
 *
 * Check docs below to see how different variants can be invoked.
 *
 * ## Upserts, Updates & Inserts
 *
 * Higher-level interfaces may choose to implement any of those verbs:
 *
 * 1. Insert: add if missing.
 * 2. Update: overwrite if present.
 * 3. Upsert: write.
 * 4. Remove: overwrite with `NULL` if present.
 *
 * Instead of adding all three to the binary C interface, we focus on better ACID transactions,
 * which can be used to implement any advanced multi-step operations (often including conditionals),
 * like Compare-And-Swap, without losing atomicity.
