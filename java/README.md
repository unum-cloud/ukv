# UKV Java SDK

These bindings are implemented via [Java Native Interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/jniTOC.html).
This interface is more performant than Python, but is not feature complete yet.
It mimics native `HashMap` and `Dictionary` classes, but has no support for batch operations yet.

```java
DataBase db = new DataBase("");
db.put(42, "purpose of life".getBytes());
assert db.get(42) == "purpose of life".getBytes() : "Big surprise";
db.close();
```

All `get` requests cause memory allocations in Java Runtime and export data into native Java types.
Most `set` requests will simply cast and forward values without additional copies.
Aside from opening and closing this class is **thread-safe** for higher interop with other Java-based tools.

Implementation follows the ["best practices" defined by IBM](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/j-jni/).
