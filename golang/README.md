# UKV GoLang SDK

GoLang bindings are implemented using [cGo](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo).
The language lacks operator and function overloads, so we can't mimic native collections.
Instead we mimic the interfaces of most commonly used ORMs.

```go
db := DataBase{}
db.Reconnect()
db.Set(42, &[]byte{4, 2})
db.Get(42)
```

Implementation-wise, GoLang variant performs `memcpy`s on essentially every call.
As GoLang has no exceptions in the classical OOP sense, most functions return multiple values, error being the last one in each pack.
Batch lookup operations are implemented via channels sending slices, to avoid reallocations.
